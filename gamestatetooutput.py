Energy: {state["combat_state"]["player"]["energy"]}
{player_powers}
Enemies:

Reflect first on the current and what you should do. The energy cost of each card is next to the name of the card inside parenthesis. It is very important that you look at how much energy you have and if you have enough energy to play the cards you want to play. Please ensure you have enough energy for the cards you want to play. You can ONLY play cards that are currently in your hand. To play a card from your hand, type '{{play}}' with the name of the card and the target index if the card requires a target. For example, if you want to play a 'Strike', type '{{play Strike 0}}'. This will play the strike card against the enemy with index 0. If you want to play a card which does not have a target, like a defend, you don't need to include the target index. To end your turn, type '{{end}}'. To use a potion use the {{potion}} action. For example, if you want to use your first potion, type {{potion use 0}}. 0 is the index of the potion slot with the potion you want to play, so the second potion slot is index 1 and so on. If the potion requires a target enemy, add the index of that enemy after the potion slot index. Write a list of these actions in the order you want to perform them in. If you are playing a special card that requires you to make another choice after playing it, like if you draw a new card and you want to see that card before doing anything else, simply don't do any other actions after that and you will be prompted with the new game state. Ending your turn will end your turn, so you should only do that when you are sure you don't want to do anything else. After thinking through what cards you want to play, double check if you have enough energy to play all those cards by adding together all their energy costs in a math equation. VERY IMPORTANT!!! Do NOT use curly brackets anywhere else except when you are performing an action. If you use curly brackets anywhere else, the action inside the curly brackets will be executed no matter what, so be careful to not use curly brackets when planning your actions."""

If you need room and want to discard a potion, use the action {{potion discard}} followed by the index of the potion slot of the potion you want to discard. For example, to remove ur first potion, type {{potion discard 0}}. When you choose the card reward by using an action, you will be prompted with the choice to add one of three cards to your deck, or skip it entirely to add no cards. There is no harm in looking. Write a list of all the actions you want to take, if you omit any reward from the action list, it will not be claimed or checked. Your rewards are:
